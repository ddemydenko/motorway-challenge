An API returns data about visits to the fake office. Here are the API details.

At first you need to receive an access token via `GET https://fake.com/api/login` call. The response would be:

```json
{
  "token": "1234567890abcdef"
}
```

The API `GET https://fake.com/api/visits?page={pageNo}&token={token}` returns data about visits to the fake office, in the following format:

```json
{
  "data": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Bill Murray", "date": "2018-09-02T09:11:00" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "John Doe", "date": "2018-08-30T03:24:00" }
  ],
  "total": 100
}
```
Use test/mock.js for mock data.

Where:

- `token` is the token received on the first step via `/api/login` call
- `id` is the unique key for the record
- `name` is the name of the visitor
- `date` is the date of the visit
- `total` is the total count of records in the system
- `pageNo` starts from 1

You need to write a script that calculates how many times each visitor has visited the office.

**Please take into account:**

- The whole dataset is ordered by the `name` field
- We are only interested in tracking weekday visits, weekend visits should be ignored.
- Data is not static. Visits could occur while you are fetching the API response. However, records can only be inserted and it would be always todayâ€™s visits. Visits cannot be undone.
- We should ignore visits from the current day, since the day is still in progress
- It's better to execute parallel requests to API.
- Bonus points for request pool (not necessary).
- Bonus points for retries.
